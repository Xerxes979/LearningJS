This is a long form tutorial set that I am doing for my work at Nifco so that I can make a webapp for their training material. I am aware that it's egregious overkill for the task at hand. I could make a powerapp and be done in a day. However, I have lots of extra time on the clock, and I have the opportunity to learn a real skill that will be useful in my career, so I'm learning JavaScript. I'm doing it right. To solve the given problems, I'm copying zero code. I just finished day 8 and I haven't even opened StackOverflow yet, and I'm going to do my very best to keep it that way.  

I'm using https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript to guide my learning. I like it because it provides lots of practice problems to cover the content taught, but I pretty much only do the level 3 (hardest) problems in the interest of time. The first couple of days of content I had no issues with due to previous experience in python, and I tanked them in a couple hours of work each. Day 8 took me a long time. I realized that I have never really dug into using objects before. The first few days were a good review of basic coding structures that I was already reasonably good at, but starting day 8 I'm mostly learning new content, so my progress is going to be slower. 

If anyone is wondering about the erratic commit schedule, after I started day 8 I got a real project to work on from my boss and had to take a break for a few weeks to do that. But I should be relatively consistent on commits until finishing the 30 days now that I'm done with that.
